The data we're goint to be using can be located at [http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/rankings?sportCode=MBB]. This page requires us to do some clicking, and doesn't have all of the stats centralized in one csv. So to automate this we will use selenium, instead of doing ~12000 clicks ourselves. To do this we used the chrome based webdriver in selenium, to run this script you will need the [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Once we have this installed we can now the following script to download every team stat available from every date of the 2018-2019 Men's Basketball season."
