    "The National Collegiate Athletic Association (<a href= \"https://www.ncaa.com/\">NCAA</a>) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the well-being and lifelong success of college athletes. The NCAA was built in 1910 and they essentially  regulates competitions between universities and colleges. They organize athletic programs such as basketball, footbal, soccer, basketball, etc. Currently 1,117 college and universities are a part of the NCAA.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will be focusing on basketball. We will collect data about an entire NCAA season and build predictive models whether a team win or lose. We will start by getting the necessary datas to build our models. We will be search for datasets that contain specific statisics that occurs in a basketball game such as the number of turn overs, assists, blocks, rebounds, field goal percentage, etc. We will tidy the data and we will try to find correlations between each statistic and a team's winrate. This all leads up to the purpose of this tutorial, which is whether we can predict whether a team will win a game if they have a certain amount of rebounds, assists, turnovers, etc. Hopefully this tutorial can provide all of you basketball enthusiasts an insight of how these datas can predict the outcome of a game."
