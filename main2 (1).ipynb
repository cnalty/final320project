    "The National Collegiate Athletic Association (<a href= \"https://www.ncaa.com/\">NCAA</a>) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the well-being and lifelong success of college athletes. The NCAA was built in 1910 and they essentially  regulates competitions between universities and colleges. They organize athletic programs such as basketball, footbal, soccer, basketball, etc. Currently 1,117 college and universities are a part of the NCAA.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will be focusing on basketball. We will collect data about an entire NCAA season and build predictive models whether a team win or lose. We will start by getting the necessary datas to build our models. We will be search for datasets that contain specific statisics that occurs in a basketball game such as the number of turn overs, assists, blocks, rebounds, field goal percentage, etc. We will tidy the data and we will try to find correlations between each statistic and a team's winrate. This all leads up to the purpose of this tutorial, which is whether we can predict whether a team will win a game if they have a certain amount of rebounds, assists, turnovers, etc. Hopefully this tutorial can provide all of you basketball enthusiasts an insight of how these datas can predict the outcome of a game."

For example, Florida International in the box scores dataset is have a different name in the game statistics data (FIU). Since we are going to going to use the names as the keys and the box scores to train our predictive model, we need to create a team name maping from the game statistics to box scores. Therefore, if a specific team name in the game statistics doesn't exist in the box scores, we can use the maping to map to the equivalent data.

    "Machine learning has become more and more popular. The idea of data science starts from business analysis. Business analysts use statistics to predict and determine whether a decision or a contract will generate profit. From that idea, people started to incorporate data science into other aspects, including sports. People try to build models that can predict whether a certain team will win a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started from data collection and data cleaning. This process is the bulk of all data analysis. We need to research different data sets and find ones that we suits our need. We then continue to read the data and clean the data. We use pandas as our primary dataframe because they provide a good representation for the data. We use techniques such as merging, droping and adding columns, mapping, and others to transform our data into something that is interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then display some graphs to get a view of how the data look like. We use matplotlib as our graphing tool and we made scatter plots to see how the different statistic interact with each other. We saw that some statistics such as field goal percentage did not have a strong correlation. We then graph different statistics with the average and win rate and try to find specific statistics that have a strong correlation with win rate. We then decided that those statistics might be usefull to build our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning our data and choosing specific parameters, we can finally build our predictive models. We used our box scores dataset to train our models. We used ScikitLearn and SciPy as our main library because they have a lot of different regression models that we can use. We did logistic regression, random forests, and Support Vector Classification (SVC) which are all models that we use to predict the winning team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall there are so much more to explore in the data science world. This tutorial is just a sneak peek into data science in the sports world. Today, we have countless of data for everything and you can definately use the skills in this tutorial for other aspects. If you are interested in learning more about data science in basketball, the https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/basketball page displays a lot of interesting data science articles on basketball. Thank you so much for reading our tutorial and we hope that this tutorial may spark the inner data scientist in you.\n",
